This is my first learning attempt with Github. I would certainly consider myself a coder but its a new skill that ive been interested in for a long time
and I have self taught with my partner over the last 18months approximately. We started out with an interest in building digital assets as opposed to typical 
accumulation of money in a banking system. I had left a proffesion from the Chemical Indsutry with an analytical background and my partner had his own IT business in the past.
What started as an investment plan actually turned into being SUCKED INTO day trading the markets on a very Micro view scale. Although our portfolio did go beyond just Bitcoin
at the beginning looking at things like Monero , Cardano , Stellar , Etherium , Dash , Ox , Tesoz , Bat these were in infancy stages and trading didnt go to plan.
